I'm a research scientist and project lead at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/).

I'm broadly passionate about machine learning, and in particular about its applications to computer vision problems. My main research interests at the moment are **continual learning**, **domain adaptation/generalization**, **model robustness** and **uncertainty**.

Before joining NLE, I was a Ph.D. student (2015-2018) and postdoc (2018-2019) at [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it). During my studies, I also spent some time at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) and [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/).
