I'm a research scientist, working on AI.

I work at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/), in the computer vision team. Previously, I was working at [IIT](https://www.iit.it), as a Ph.D. student first (2015-2018) and a postdoc then (2018-2019). During my studies, I also spent some time at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/).

I am broadly passionated about machine learning and computer vision. My main research interests at the moment are **domain adaptation**, **domain generalization**, **model robustness** and **continual learning**.
