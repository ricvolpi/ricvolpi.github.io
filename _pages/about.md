I'm a scientist working on machine learning problems. I'm currently interested in improving the explainability and reliability of computer vision models (but I like switching to new problems more often than I probably should). In the past years I've worked on domain adaptation, domain generalization, continual learning, fairness, adversarial robustness, ML for neuroscience and several others topics.

I'm currently working as a research scientist and project lead at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/). Before joining NLE, I was a Ph.D. student (2015-2018) and postdoc (2018-2019) at [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it). During my studies, I also spent some time at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) and [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/).

When I'm not in the lab, I love travelling, taking photos and reading books.
