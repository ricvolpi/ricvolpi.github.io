I'm a scientist, having fun with machine learning.

I recently joined [Arsenale BioYards](https://www.arsenale.bio) as a senior scientist. Previously, I worked as a research scientist and project lead at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/). Before that, I was a Ph.D. student (2015-2018) and postdoc (2018-2019) at [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it). During my studies, I also spent some time at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) and [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/).

In the past years I've worked on several topics, such as 
[domain adaptation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Volpi_Adversarial_Feature_Augmentation_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf), [domain generalization](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/1d94108e907bb8311d8802b48fd54b4a-Paper.pdf),  [continual learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Volpi_On_the_Road_to_Online_Adaptation_for_Semantic_Image_Segmentation_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf), [algorithmic fairness](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/LLID/papers/Ragonesi_Learning_Unbiased_Representations_via_Mutual_Information_Backpropagation_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf), [adversarial robustness](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/5434a6b40f8f65488e722bc33d796c8b-Paper-Conference.pdf) and [ML for neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73691-z).

When I'm not in the lab, I love skiing, travelling, taking photos and reading. Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:rvolpi@hey.com).

P.S. I am currently not reviewing conference and journal papers.
