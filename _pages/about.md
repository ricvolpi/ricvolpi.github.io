I'm a scientist, working at the intersection between machine learning and computer vision.

I'm part of the computer vision team at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/), as a research scientist. Previously, I was part of the [PAVIS](https://pavis.iit.it/) group at [IIT](https://www.iit.it), as a Ph.D. student first (2015-2018) and a postdoc then (2018-2019), advised by [Vittorio Murino](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~swan/). During my studies, I also spent six months at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/), advised by [Silvio Savarese](https://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/).

My research is mostly focused on learning visual representations that are robust under challenging conditions. For example, deploying models in unknown domains, or learning from severely biased datasets. Recently, I started gaining interest in continual learning problems, with special focus on continual domain adaptation.

In the past, I've also worked on applications of machine learning for [high-dimensional retinal data](https://www.renvision-fp7.eu/).
