I'm a scientist, working at the intersection between machine learning and computer vision.

I'm currently part of the computer vision team at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/), as a postdoctoral research scientist. Previously, I was part of the [PAVIS](https://pavis.iit.it/) group at [IIT](https://www.iit.it), as a Ph.D. student first (2015-2018) and a postdoc then (2018-2019), advised by [Vittorio Murino](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~swan/). During my studies, I also spent six months at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/), advised by [Silvio Savarese](https://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/).

My research is mostly devoted to learning visual representations that are robust under more or less pathological conditions. For example, deploying models in unknown domains, or learning from severely biased datasets. Recently, I started gaining interest in lifelong-learning and meta-learning problems.

Before, I've also worked on applications of machine learning for [high-dimensional retinal data](https://www.renvision-fp7.eu/).
