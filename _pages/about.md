I'm a scientist, working at the intersection between machine learning and computer vision.

I'm currently part of the computer vision team at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/), as a postdoctoral research scientist. Previously, I was part of the PAVIS group at [IIT](https://pavis.iit.it/), as a Ph.D. student first (2015-2018) and a postdoc then (2018-2019), advised by [Vittorio Murino](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~swan/). During my studies, I also spent six months at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/), advised by [Silvio Savarese](https://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/).

My research is mostly devoted to learning visual representations that are robust under more or less pathological conditions. For instance,  deploying models in unknown domains, and learning from severely biased datasets. Currently, I started gaining interest in lifelong-learning and meta-learning. In general, I'm ***not*** interested in marginal improvements on over-studied benchmarks. 

Before reaching a (sort of) convergence to my current interests, I've also worked on applications of machine learning to make sense of [high-dimensional retinal data](https://www.renvision-fp7.eu/).

When I'm not doing research, I love traveling and snapping pictures with my Canon. Feel free to drop me an email!
