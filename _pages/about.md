I'm a scientist, working on computer vision and machine learning problems.

My main research interest is improving the reliability of machine learning models in new environments. In the past years I've worked on several topics, such as 
[domain adaptation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Volpi_Adversarial_Feature_Augmentation_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf), [domain generalization](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/1d94108e907bb8311d8802b48fd54b4a-Paper.pdf),  [continual learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Volpi_On_the_Road_to_Online_Adaptation_for_Semantic_Image_Segmentation_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf), [algorithmic fairness](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/LLID/papers/Ragonesi_Learning_Unbiased_Representations_via_Mutual_Information_Backpropagation_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf), [adversarial robustness](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/5434a6b40f8f65488e722bc33d796c8b-Paper-Conference.pdf) and [ML for neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73691-z).

My current job is research scientist and project lead at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/). Before joining NLE, I was a Ph.D. student (2015-2018) and postdoc (2018-2019) at [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it). During my studies, I also spent some time at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) and [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/).

When I'm not in the lab, I love skiing, travelling, taking photos and reading.
