I'm a research scientist, working on AI.

I work at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/), where I lead a project about continual learning/adaptation for computer vision models. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student (2015-2018) and a postdoc (2018-2019) at [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it). During my studies, I also spent some time at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) and [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/).

I am broadly passionate about applications of machine learning to computer vision problems. My main research interests at the moment are **domain adaptation**, **domain generalization**, **model robustness** and **continual learning**.
